======
 
## Submission Instructions
* Read this document entirely and estimate how long this assignment will take.
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork called `lab-11`
* Set up Travis CI to your forked repo
* **A deployed Heroku URL is not due until Lab 12, but you should start working on deployment for this lab now** 
* Create a pull request from your lab branch branch to your `master` branch
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation,your original estimate, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request


## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to create a single resource API using the express framework with MongoDB
* students will be able to leverage 3rd party helper modules for debugging, logging, and handling errors

## Requirements
For this assignment you will be building a RESTful HTTP server using Express and MongoDB.

### Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.env** - contains env variables **(should be git ignored)**
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
* **.eslintrc.json** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create `dbon` and `dboff` scripts for managing the mongo daemon
* **db/** - contains mongodb files **(should be git ignored)**
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **model/** - contains module definitions
* **route/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains test modules


#### Model
In the model/ directory create a Model for a resource using Mongoose (that is different from the class lecture resource). The model must include 4 properties, two of which should be required.

#### Server Endpoints
Create the following routes for performing CRUD opperations on your resource. The [Mongoose docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#Model) will be your best friend in researching the correct methods you need to use to properly create, read, update, and destroy a resource in the Mongo database. 
* `POST /api/<resource-name>`
  * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
  * on success respond with a 200 status code and the created note
  * on failure due to a bad request, send a 400 status code
  * on failure due to a duplicate request, send a 409 status code
* `GET /api/<resource-name>` and `GET /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * with no id in the query string it should respond with an array of all of your resources
  * with an id in the query string it should respond with the details of a specifc resource (as JSON)
  * on failure if the id is not found, respond with a 404
* `DELETE /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * the route should delete a resource with the given id
  * on success this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body
  * on failure due to lack of id in the query, respond with a 400 status code
  * on failure due to the id and resource not existing, respond with a 404 status code


## Tests
* Write tests to ensure the `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
* `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
* `GET`: test 404, for  requests made with an id that was not found
* `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body
* `POST`: test 400, if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
* `DELETE`: test 204, it should respond with this status code for successful deletion of a resource
* `DELETE`: test 404, it should respond with this status code for a request made with an invalid id

## Bonus (up to 3 points)
* `PUT /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * the route should update a resource with the given id
  * on success this should return a 200 status code with the newly updated body
  * on failure due to lack of id in the query, respond with a 400 status code
  * on failure due to passing in a property that does not exist on the schema or passing an empty body, respond with a 400 status code
  * on failure due to the id and resource not existing, respond with a 404 status code
  * on failure due to a duplicate request, send a 409 status code
* Test your PUT route for a 409 status code, a 404 status code, and for the two different conditions listed above to get the 400 status codes (*no points offered for testing for successul 200 put request because that was already given in lecture code*)


## Documentation
- carRouter.post('/api/cars/) this will post a new car to the database
- carRouter.get('/api/cars/:id?') this will go to the db and search for a car based on the given id
- carRouter.put('/api/cars/:id?') this will find a car in the db based on the given id and change properties
- carRouter.delete('/api/cars/:id?') this will find a car in the db based on the given id and delete it

## GET api/cars/{id}
