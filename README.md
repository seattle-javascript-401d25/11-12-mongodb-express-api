======

## Submission Instructions
* Read this document entirely and estimate how long this assignment will take.
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork called `lab-11`
* Set up Travis CI to your forked repo
* **A deployed Heroku URL is not due until Lab 12, but you should start working on deployment for this lab now** 
* Create a pull request from your lab branch branch to your `master` branch
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation,your original estimate, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request


## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to create a single resource API using the express framework with MongoDB
* students will be able to leverage 3rd party helper modules for debugging, logging, and handling errors

## Requirements
For this assignment you will be building a RESTful HTTP server using Express and MongoDB.

### Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.env** - contains env variables **(should be git ignored)**
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
* **.eslintrc.json** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create `dbon` and `dboff` scripts for managing the mongo daemon
* **db/** - contains mongodb files **(should be git ignored)**
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **model/** - contains module definitions
* **route/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains test modules


#### Model
In the model/ directory create a Model for a resource using Mongoose (that is different from the class lecture resource). The model must include 4 properties, two of which should be required.

#### Server Endpoints
Create the following routes for performing CRUD opperations on your resource. The [Mongoose docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#Model) will be your best friend in researching the correct methods you need to use to properly create, read, update, and destroy a resource in the Mongo database. 
* DONE: `POST /api/<resource-name>`
  * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
  * on success respond with a 200 status code and the created note
  * on failure due to a bad request, send a 400 status code
  * on failure due to a duplicate request, send a 409 status code
* DONE `GET /api/<resource-name>` and `GET /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * with no id in the query string it should respond with an array of all of your resources
  * with an id in the query string it should respond with the details of a specifc resource (as JSON)
  * on failure if the id is not found, respond with a 404
* DONE `DELETE /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * the route should delete a resource with the given id
  * on success this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body
  * on failure due to lack of id in the query, respond with a 400 status code
  * on failure due to the id and resource not existing, respond with a 404 status code


## Tests
* Write tests to ensure the `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
* `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
* `GET`: test 404, for  requests made with an id that was not found
* `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body
* `POST`: test 400, if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
* `DELETE`: test 204, it should respond with this status code for successful deletion of a resource
* `DELETE`: test 404, it should respond with this status code for a request made with an invalid id

## Bonus (up to 3 points)
* `PUT /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * the route should update a resource with the given id
  * DONE on success this should return a 200 status code with the newly updated body
  * DONE on failure due to lack of id in the query, respond with a 400 status code
  * DONE on failure due to passing in a property that does not exist on the schema or passing an empty body, respond with a 400 status code
  * DONE on failure due to the id and resource not existing, respond with a 404 status code
  * DONE on failure due to a duplicate request, send a 409 status code
* Test your PUT route for a 409 status code, a 404 status code, and for the two different conditions listed above to get the 400 status codes (*no points offered for testing for successul 200 put request because that was already given in lecture code*)


## Documentation
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README. List all of your registered routes and describe their behavior. Describe what your resouce is. Imagine you are providing this API to other developers who need to research your API in order to use it. Describe how a developer should be able to make requests to your API. Refer to the [PokeAPI docs](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#resource-lists) for a good example to follow.
